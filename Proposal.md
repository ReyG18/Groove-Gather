## Project Summary

Groove Gather is a subscription-based dance meetup website where users can create profiles, upload dance videos, view other dancers' videos, and optionally monetize their content with a premium subscription. Users can enter their location to find others for collaborations, recreational meetups, or hosting classes. The platform also features a dance supply store for purchasing items like yoga mats, apparel, and accessories.
